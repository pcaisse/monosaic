Create photomosaic from a single image

Typically [photographic mosaics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_mosaic) are made up of many smaller images. This script allows the user to create photomosaics with only one source image. The image is divided up into tiles which are rearranged to look like a model image.

For example:

![source image](http://i.imgur.com/lgHzG8H.jpg "Source Image")

![model image](http://i.imgur.com/Dbz0FT1.jpg "Model Image")

![result image](http://i.imgur.com/DycONws.jpg "Result Image")

The inspiration for this project was Mother's Day :)
